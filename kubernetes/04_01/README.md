# Expose Your Application to the Internet with a LoadBalancer


- Up until this point, we've deployed an application, but we've only been able to access it by using a busybox container inside the cluster.

How do you expose your application to the internet?

The answer is a Kubernetes **Service**. A Kubernetes service is a **load balancer** that directs traffic from the internet to Kubernetes pods.

Key points about a LoadBalancer service:
- It has a **public** and **static** IP address.
- The **public IP** means anyone can access it from the internet.
- The **static** IP is important because pods and their IPs change frequently, but the service IP needs to remain the same.

### Service YAML Manifest Overview

We're going to create a service called `demo-service` in the `development` namespace.

Important part:
- The **selector map** tells the service which pods to route traffic to.
- In this case: `app: pod-info`

Check your **deployment spec** to ensure:
- Pods created have the label `app: pod-info`
- If labels donâ€™t match, the service wonâ€™t direct traffic properly.

### Port Configuration

- The service port is set to **80** (default HTTP port, so it doesnâ€™t need to be typed in the URL).
- Internally, traffic is sent to port **3000** in the container.

### Service Type

- The type is set to **LoadBalancer**
- Kubernetes supports 3 types of services:
  1. ClusterIP
  2. NodePort
  3. LoadBalancer (used here)

### Deploying the Service

1. **Open a new terminal tab** and run:

```

minikube tunnel

```

2. **In your original tab**, apply the service manifest:

```

kubectl apply -f service.yaml

```

3. **Check the external IP** with:

```

kubectl get services -n development

```

You'll see two IP addresses:
- Internal cluster IP
- External IP (Note: in Minikube, this is typically `127.0.0.1`, your localhost)

**Important Note**:
- Minikube only works locally, so it wonâ€™t provide a real public IP.
- On cloud providers like GCP, AWS, or Azure, you will get an actual public IP.

### Testing the Application

1. Copy the external IP (usually `127.0.0.1`) into your browser.
2. If it doesn't work:
- Check the terminal running `minikube tunnel`
- You might need to enter your system password to allow the tunnel.
3. Try accessing the app again â€” you should see the JSON object from the pod info app.

### Wrap Up

- Stop the tunnel process with `Ctrl + C`
- Congratulations! You've successfully used a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service to expose your app to the internet ðŸŽ‰

**Reminder**:
Minikube tunnel can be finicky. If it didnâ€™t work perfectly â€” donâ€™t worry. Youâ€™ve learned the concept.
