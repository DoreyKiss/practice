# The Goal of Functional Programming

## Overview

This project explores **functional programming** and its primary goal: to manage the complexity of software systems while making code easier to test, reason about, and maintain. By understanding the _why_ behind functional programming, we can better appreciate its techniques and advantages over more traditional paradigms like object-oriented and procedural programming.

## Why Functional Programming?

Modern software—especially at the enterprise level—often suffers from bugs that are:

- **Hard to reproduce** due to convoluted runtime conditions.
- **Difficult to trace** because of the immense number of variables and states involved.

These issues commonly occur in object-oriented and procedural codebases where shared state and mutable data introduce unpredictability.

Functional programming addresses these challenges by:

- **Reducing side effects** and **shared state**.
- Encouraging the use of **pure functions** that are self-contained and easy to test.
- Structuring programs in a way that is more **predictable**, **modular**, and **mathematically sound**.

## Key Concepts

- **Pure Functions**: Functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Immutability**: Data is not changed after it's created, helping to eliminate bugs related to unexpected state changes.
- **Function Composition**: Building complex logic by combining simpler functions.
- **Referential Transparency**: Expressions can be replaced with their values without affecting the program’s behavior.

## Functional vs Object-Oriented Programming

While object-oriented programming (OOP) models code around "objects" and their interactions, this can often lead to:

- Complex webs of relationships (inheritance hierarchies, interfaces, etc.).
- Ambiguity due to inconsistent or poorly designed abstractions.

Functional programming, on the other hand:

- Focuses on **what** should be done, not **how** to do it.
- Emphasizes **mathematical rigor**, reducing the surface area for bugs.
- Results in **more maintainable** and **testable** code.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course or project, you should:

- Understand the core principles of functional programming.
- Be able to contrast it effectively with object-oriented paradigms.
- Apply functional techniques to write cleaner, more reliable code.

## Declarative vs Imperative Programming

### Overview

Functional programming is **declarative**, as opposed to **imperative** styles like object-oriented and procedural programming.

- **Declarative programming** focuses on **what** things are.
- **Imperative programming** focuses on **how** to do things, step-by-step.

### Analogy: Building a House

- **Declarative**: A house _is_ a foundation, four walls, and a roof.
- **Imperative**: To build a house:
  1. Pour the foundation
  2. Build four walls
  3. Add the roof

### Example: Average of a List

#### Imperative Approach

1. Set `x = 0`
2. Add each number in the list to `x`
3. Divide `x` by the length of the list

#### Declarative Approach

- `x = sum(list) / length(list)`
- Clearly states _what_ the average is, not _how_ to calculate it.

### Key Benefits of Declarative Style

- Often more **natural** and **easier to understand**
- Feels closer to **mathematics**
- Promotes clarity by focusing on **describing results**

### Functional Programming Core Concepts

Functional programming brings mathematical function precision into programming through:

1. **Immutability** – Data does not change
2. **Separation of functions and data**
3. **First-class functions** – Functions can be passed around like any other value

# Functional Programming: Immutability

## 📌 Key Concept: Immutability

- **Definition**: Once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed.
  - In functional programming, variables are treated as **constants**.
  - Contrast: In imperative languages, variables are treated like **buckets** whose contents can change.

## 🧠 Mental Model Shift

- **Imperative/Procedural Thinking**:
  - `x` is a container that _holds_ values.
  - `x` can be updated (e.g., `x = 5`, later `x = 10`).
- **Functional Thinking**:
  - `x = 5` means "`x` is 5" — not a placeholder, but a direct identity.
  - Like how `π` is 3.14159 — you wouldn’t redefine π.

## ❗ Python Specifics

- Python has **no built-in constant keyword**.
  - Developers must **discipline themselves** not to reassign variables.

## 🧾 Example: Updating Data

- **Object-Oriented Way**:
  - Modify object properties directly.
  - Example: `employee.salary = 50000`
- **Functional Way**:
  - Create a **new version** of the data with the updated values.
  - Example using a dictionary:
    ```python
    updated_employee = { **employee, "salary": 50000 }
    ```

## ✅ Advantages of Immutability

1. **Eliminates State Change Complexity**
   - Programs are easier to understand when variables don't change.
2. **Reduces Bugs**
   - State is predictable and easier to trace.
3. **Encourages Pure Functions**
   - Output is solely determined by input; no side effects.
4. **Improves Maintainability**
   - No need to worry about unintended consequences from changes elsewhere.
5. **Scalability**
   - Helps manage large codebases by making them less fragile.

## 🔁 Summary

- In functional programming:
  - Treat all variables as **immutable**.
  - Avoid reassigning values.
  - Build programs by **defining new data**, not by modifying existing state.
- This leads to **clearer, safer, and more robust** code.


# Functional Programming: Separation of Data and Functions

## 📌 Key Concept: Separation of Data and Functions
- In **functional programming**, **data and functions are kept separate**.
- This contrasts with **object-oriented programming (OOP)** where data and functions are bundled together in objects.

---

## 🧾 Definitions

### **Data**:
- Any values in a program:
  - Employee records in a payroll app.
  - Car listings on a website.
  - Game characters' attributes.
- In OOP: Data is stored as **member variables** in objects.
- In FP: Data is typically stored in **dictionaries** or **lists**, outside of functions.

### **Functions**:
- Operations that **transform data into useful information**:
  - e.g., Calculating average salary, filtering cars, checking collisions.
- In OOP: Functions (methods) operate on internal object state using `self`.
- In FP: Functions are **pure** and accept **data as arguments**.

## ⚙️ Key Differences: OOP vs Functional Programming

| Aspect | Object-Oriented Programming | Functional Programming |
|-------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Data & Functions | Bundled together in classes | Kept completely separate |
| Data Mutation | Allowed through methods | Not allowed (immutable) |
| Access | Via `self` | Passed explicitly to functions |
| Example Structure | `class TodoItem` | `dict` representing a task |
| Transformation | Object methods change state | Functions return new modified copies |

---

## 🔐 Why Keep Data & Functions Together in OOP?
- Prevent **unsafe direct access** to variables.
- Example Problem:
  - `Person` object with `first_name`, `last_name`, and `initials`.
  - Changing names requires updating initials — easy to forget and cause bugs.
- Solution:
  - Use **private variables** (e.g., `_first_name`) and control access via methods.

---

## ✅ Why Keep Them Separate in FP?
- **Immutability** removes the need for protective encapsulation.
- Functions **never modify** original data.
  - Always **return new constants** representing updated data.
- Developers must **discipline themselves** not to mutate original data.

---

## 📋 Example: To-Do List Application

### Object-Oriented Approach:
```python
class TodoItem:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.completed = False

    def mark_done(self):
        self.completed = True

class TodoList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add_item(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
```

### Functional Approach:
```python
# Data
todo_items = [
    { "name": "Buy groceries", "completed": False },
    { "name": "Call mom", "completed": True }
]

# Function
def get_completed_items(items):
    return [item for item in items if item["completed"]]
```

---

## 🔁 Summary
- **Functional programming** emphasizes:
  - Keeping **data immutable**.
  - Keeping **functions and data separate**.
- This improves:
  - **Predictability**
  - **Testability**
  - **Code clarity**
- Focus shifts from **modifying state** to **transforming data**.

> Think of FP functions like mathematical operations — inputs go in, outputs come out, no side effects.
